\chapter{Conclusion}
In general, finding the most popular songs is a very difficult task. The popularity of a song is influenced by many factors and it is not easy to predict it. 
This project has shown that it is possible to predict the popularity of a song with a good accuracy, which could help a lot in the music industry, but it could be improved.\\
The algorithms used in this project are proved to be more accurate than the ones used in the state of the art. In the state of art the more accurate algorithm is the Logistic Regression, which has an accuracy of 0.52, while in this project it is the Random Forests with an accuracy of 0.85.\\
They both agreed on the fact that the most important feature is in general danceability, but we went further in the research to find the most important features for different regions of the world. Not all of them have danceability as the most important feature.\\

\subsection{Future Work}
For further developments of the project, it could be interesting to take into consideration also the sentiment analysis that could be done for example by analyzing what people write about a specific song or a specific artist. This could be done by using the Twitter API to get the tweets that contain the name of the artist or the song and then analyze the sentiment of the tweets. This could be used to get a better understanding of the sentiment of the people towards a specific song or artist and then use this information to improve the model.\\
The sentiment analysis could be used also with the lyrics of the songs. Finding out if a happy song is more keen to be popular than a sad song could be interesting.\\
