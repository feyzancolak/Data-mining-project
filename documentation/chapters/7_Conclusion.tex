\subsection{Future Work}
For further developments of the project, it could be interesting to take into consideration also the sentiment analysis that could be done for example by analyzing what people write about a specific song or a specific artist. This could be done by using the Twitter API to get the tweets that contain the name of the artist or the song and then analyze the sentiment of the tweets. This could be used to get a better understanding of the sentiment of the people towards a specific song or artist and then use this information to improve the model.\\
The sentiment analysis could be used also with the lyrics of the songs.
